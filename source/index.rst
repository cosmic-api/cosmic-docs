Cosmic Docs
===========

Welcome to Cosmic Docs! This document will describe in detail the architecture of Cosmic and provide a strict specification that every implementation of Cosmic must follow. The canonical implementation is written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_. If you would like to get started with Cosmic, dive into the `Python documentation </documentation/python/>`_ and use this document as a reference. If you would like to hack on Cosmic, this document is for you.
